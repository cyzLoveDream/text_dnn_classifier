# text_dnn_classifier
Contains common depth text classification neural network, The deep neural network will eventually be combined with xgboost;

operating environment: 

python 3.6.0+ anaconda3

you should install keras gensim jieba tqdm  ConfigParser 

the fiels contains data sample, you can directly run it! this is 360 of ccf,so the data is very ugly. I haven't good idea,

this is a simple example. I will add the most NLP network in it soon after.

Later, I will draw lessons from the contest of ideas, and make update.

Finally I will try to NLP combining neural network and the traditional machine learning (eg. xgboost, ML, Lightgbm), this will be creative 

thinking for the objective.
